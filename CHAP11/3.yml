#When you need to pass characters that are invalid for URL, such as â€ž < > # % \ | ^ [ ] ` spaces. For instance, whitespace is not a valid URL character, since it would be ambiguous to spot the full URL in texts if they would contain whitespaces.
#When you need to pass characters that are reserved for URL, such as ! # $ % & ' ( ) * + , / : ; = ? @ [ ]. For instance, ? is reserved to mark start of query parameters, and if we do not encode ? in the path or inside query parameter, it might break the syntax.
