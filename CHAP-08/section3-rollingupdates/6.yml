#By default, Ansible only halts play execution when all hosts in a batch experience a failure.However, you might want a play to abort if more than a certain percentage of hosts in the inventory have failed, even if no entire batch has failed.
#a "fail fast" strategy, set the max_fail_percentage to a value of zero.
